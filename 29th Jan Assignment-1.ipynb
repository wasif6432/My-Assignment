    "\n",
    "1) Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Python is a versatile programming language that supports multiple programming :\n",
    "    a) Imperative programming\n",
    "    b) Procedural programming\n",
    "    c) object-oriented programming(oop)\n",
    "    d) fuctional programming\n",
    "    e) scripting\n",
    "    f) dynamic programming\n",
    "    g) Meta programming\n",
    "    h) Event-driven programming\n",
    "    i) web development\n",
    "    j) game development\n",
    "    \n",
    "3) Yes, Python is case-sensitive when it comes to identifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) The correct extension for Python source code files is \".py.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Python is typically considered an interpreted programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) a) Function (Def)\n",
    "   b) Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)\n",
    "   c) Loops (for and while)\n",
    "   d) Classes and Methods (Object-Oriented Programming)\n",
    "   e) Try-Except Blocks (Error Handling)\n",
    "   \n",
    "7) In Python, you can use the hash symbol (#) to create single-line comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) python ---version\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using a construct called \"lambda\" functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "10) \"pip\"  stands for \"Pip Installs Packages\" or \"Pip Installs Python.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "11) print() , type(), len(), sum(), int(), float(), insert(), sorted(), count().\n",
    "\n",
    "12)  the maximum possible length of an identifier is not explicitly defined by the language specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "13) There are several benefits to using Python in various application domains:\n",
    "    Readability and Simplicity, Large Standard Library, Cross-Platform Compatibility, Community and Support, Open Source and Free, \n",
    "    \n",
    "14) Memory management in Python is primarily managed by the Python memory manager, which automates the process of allocating and deallocating memory for objects in your Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "15) first we will Download Python, then Run the Installer, then Customize Installation (Optional) then, Complete the Installation then, Verify Installation then, Set Up Path Variables :\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you forgot to check the \"Add Python to PATH\" option during installation, or if you need to set up path variables manually for some reason, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Open the Start menu and search for \"Environment Variables.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Click on \"Edit the system environment variables.\" In the System Properties window, click the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. Under \"System variables,\" scroll down and find the \"Path\" variable. Select it and click \"Edit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    d. Click \"New\" and add the path to the Python installation directory. The default installation path is usually      C:\\Users\\<Your Username>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3x (where \"3x\" is the version number).\n",
    "\n",
    "    e. Click \"OK\" to close the windows.\n",
